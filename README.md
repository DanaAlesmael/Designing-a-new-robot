In this task, the main foucs was designing a new robot to do specific tasks without using any an exsiting design/files. A hand sketch of various ideas was made to finalize the appearance of the robot. The following points summarize the main points and reasons of why it was designed that way:
* Head: Since robots are created with the purpose to mimic normal human activities, the idea of half robot and half human face was applied. 
* Neck: 
* Body: Since the body will contain various components such as push button, papaer holder, and OLED screen, its design was made simply with one block that was emptied from inside to help organizing all electrical components.

1. The idea of push button was integrated to control the papaer holder part in which pressing this button will result the holder to open so that the user can take a paper. 

2. For organization purpose, a holder for the papaers that need to be submited was designed. This part has Rack and pinion gear attached to the holder's lower part and can be controlled using a specific type of motors.
