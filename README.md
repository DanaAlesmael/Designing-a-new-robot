# Designing-a-new-robot

In this task, the main foucs was designing a new robot to do specific tasks without using any an exsiting design/files. A hand sketch of various ideas was made to finalize the appearance of the robot. The following points summarize the main points and reasons of why it was designed that way:

* Head: Since robots are created with the purpose to mimic normal human activities, the idea of half robot and half human face was applied. 

1. Robot side: This side contained the basic elements that represent robots.

2. Human side: This side contained simple drawing of half eyes, nose, and lip. 

- The idea was to give the face on the side more robotic look by adding different materials. However, it was kept simple due to shortage of time.  

* Neck: 

* Body: Since the body will contain various components such as papaer holder, push button, and OLED screen, its design was made simply with one block that was emptied from inside and slimed from outside to help organizing all electrical components and balacen/ or easier movement, respectively. For accurate design and perfect fit of all mentioned components, their datasheet were followed.

1. For organization purpose, a holder for the papaers that need to be submited was designed. This part has something similar to Rack and pinion gear attached to its side and can be controlled using a specific type of motors that located at the back. Everytime the servo moves, the attached component will rotate reulting the drawser to open. The following videos can be used as a reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbQr3A-YAr0 , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ci4ssVTRz0 and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmcgTaE45_Y

2. The idea of push button was integrated to control the papaer holder part in which pressing this button will result the holder to open so that the user can take a paper. This all can be done using a programming language to determine the moving angle of the motor as this button pressed. 
[Extra: Another idea thought of was using motion sensor for automatic opening process in which the distance that determine when this condition is true should be calculated]. 

3. OLED screen was also integrated as an indicator of the contained papers' number. It should be programmed to welcome the user first as the button pressed and then when the holder closed, a number should be displayed. This number to demonstrate number of papers left on the holder. [Extra: It can display time and date when no operation is happening]. Velcro can be used to attach the screen to the robot's body for easiness. 

* Hands: 

* Legs: Since the main functionality of this robot was clear from the begining, it made the robot legs' designing easier. To move away fom the normal shape and previous tasks, a scooter-like component was attached to the robot. [The idea of this is similar to "pepper robot"]. 



Various considerations should be taken into account before starting this process: 
* Electrical components: 
* Number and location of motors: To avoid complecating stuff, poppy robot was followed as a referece in terms of number and location of motors in which they were fixed depending on the main functionality of this new robot which is distributing papers. 
* Connection parts [screws, hinge,...]:  
* Cost.
* Weight.
