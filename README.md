# Designing-a-new-robot

In this task, the main foucs was designing a new robot to do specific tasks without using any an exsiting design/files. A hand sketch of various ideas was made to finalize the appearance of the robot. The following points summarize the main points and reasons of why it was designed that way:

* Head: Since robots are created with the purpose to mimic normal human activities, the idea of half robot and half human face was applied. 

1. Robot side:

2. Human side: 

* Neck: 

* Body: Since the body will contain various components such as papaer holder, push button, and OLED screen, its design was made simply with one block that was emptied from inside to help organizing all electrical components. For accurate design and perfect fit of all mentioned components, their datasheet were followed.

1. For organization purpose, a holder for the papaers that need to be submited was designed. This part has Rack and pinion gear attached to its lower part and can be controlled using a specific type of motors. The following video can be used as a reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbQr3A-YAr0

2. The idea of push button was integrated to control the papaer holder part in which pressing this button will result the holder to open so that the user can take a paper. This all can be done using a programming language to determine the moving angle of the motor as this button pressed. 

3. OLED screen was also integrated as an indicator of the contained papers' number. It should be programmed to welcome the user first as the button pressed and then when the holder closed, a number should be displayed. This number to demonstrate number of papers left on the holder. [Extra: It can display time and date when no operation is happening]. 

* Hands: 

* Legs: 



Various considerations should be taken into account before starting this process: 
* Number of motors: 
* Location of motors: 
* Connection parts [screws, hinge,...]:  
* Cost: 
* Weight:
